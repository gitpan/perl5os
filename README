# This message contains the description of the patch.
# The actual patch will be posted to p5-p later, the parts that
# are relevant to other lists will be posted there separately
#
# This is needed _before_ application of the patch:

mkdir os2
touch os2/Makefile.SH hints/os2.sh os2/os2.c os2/os2ish.h
touch ext/DynaLoader/dl_os2.xs
exit 0

Notes on the patch:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) run the above commands
1') apply andy's patch if not applied already
2)  patches should be applied as
	patch -p1 <.....

Patches are relative to perl5.001m + Andy's patch.
It is tested under Solaris and OS/2.
The complete distribution of this patch is available on
	ftp://ftp.math.ohio-state.edu/pub/users/ilya/os2

Target:
~~~~~~~

This is not supposed to make a perfect Perl on OS/2. This patch is
concerned only with perfect _build_ of Perl on OS/2. A lot of good
features from Andreas Kaiser port missed this patch.

Annotations of changes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) C files
2) Configure
3) MakeMaker
4) Build tools

1) C files
	a) mkfifo macro added to Posix.c
	b) Copyright notice for OS/2 port changed
	c) MYMALLOC section in perl.h moved (why?)
	d) setgrent grent and getgrent wrapped in ifdef
	e) declarations for #if defined(MYMALLOC) && defined(HIDEMYMALLOC)
		added
	f) some diagnostics added to tests

2) Configure 
	0) Differences are provided with plain 5.001m + andys.
	a) New vars exe_ext obj_ext lib_ext ar plibext 
		firstmakefile archobjs cldlibs path_sep
		I think they should be set by the hints files only
	b) Support for extraction from NE style libraries.
	c) a lot of 
			cc -o whatever
		lines did not have $ldopts.
	d) The above variables are used throughout the file for checks

3) MakeMaker
	a) Makefiles and related scripts made to use $(O), $(A), $(AR)
		using the vars found by Configure or defaulted to some
		reasonable value.
	b) New attribute DLBASE added
	c) Path separator made sane.
	d) {{ and }} are special in dmake (still does not work :-().
	e) added section on .DEF file generation.
	f) Added support for the name of DLL being different from the 
		name of the extention.

4) Build tools and libraries

	Since Configure can go out of sync with the other tools,
		all the added configuration variables are checked for
		existence, if not, set to reasonable values. Thus the
		changes are independent of Configure patch.
	
	a) ln changed to $ln in some places
	b) Makefiles and related scripts made to use $(O), $(A), $(AR)
		using the vars found by Configure or defaulted to
		some reasonable value.
	c) $firstmakefile is the file make looks onto before Makefile
	d) $plibext is the extension for the perl library
	e) $archobjs is the list of additional object files needed for
		local build.
	   $cldlibs are libs to use when linking miniperl.
	f) Sanity checks look for perl$Config{exe_ext}.
	g) installperl was looping through config.sh in a wrong way
	h) installperl needs to change permission to 0777 before
		unlink on OS/2.
	i) Cwd.pm updated for OS/2.                                   
	j) Find.pm updated for OS/2.                                  
	k) Shell.pm updated for OS/2.                                 
	l) Makefile.SH : added sh in front of some commands           
	   if $d_shrplib is 'custom', looks into                      
	        $osname/Makefile.$osname.SH to construct the section  
	        on shared Perl library.                               
	m) clean target extended to delete some intermediate files    
	n) Test::Harness works.


Notes on build on OS/2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The change of C code in this patch is based on the ak port of 5.001+.

a) Make sure your sort is not the broken OS/2 one.

b) when extraction perl5.001m.tar.gz you need to extract perl5.001m/Configure
separately, since by default perl5.001m/configure overwrites it;

c) Necessary manual intervention when compiling on OS/2:

	Need to put perl.dll on LIBPATH after it is created.

d) Compile summary:

# Look for hints/os2.sh and correct what is different on your system
# I have rather spartan configuration.

	# Prefix means where to install:
sh Configure -des -D prefix=f:/perl5m
make
	# Will probably die after build of miniperl (unless you have DLL
	# from previous compile). Need to move DLL where it belongs
make
	# some warnings in POSIX.c
make test
	# some tests fail, 10 on my system
	#
	# before this you should create subdirs bin and lib in the 
	# prefix directory (f:/perl5m above):
make install
	# man pages are not installed

e) At the end of August GNU make and pdksh were too buggy for compile.
Both maintainers have patches that make it possible to compile perl.
They are included into distribution of this patch on 
	ftp://ftp.math.ohio-state.edu/pub/users/ilya/os2

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you see that some '/' became '\' in pdksh 5.2.3, you did not apply
my patches!
Same with segfaults in Make 3.74.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Problems reported: 

a) one of the latest tr is broken, get an old one :-(
	1.11 works. (On compuserver?)
b) You need a perlglob.exe and link386.
c) Get rid of invalid perl.dll on your LIBPATH.
